- move to TS
- fix resource manager
- move centered to box
- clean game with scenes
- make standard systems and game systems

# For engine
- ui buttons
- keyframe animation system + tools for recording
- text system
- ECS debugger (register components, name entities)
- camera
- resize component
- sprite animation system

# Ideas for powers
- quarantine - select card and it doesn't move
- vaccine - card stays face up
- clorox - can kill the germs
- mask - slows down the virus spread (should be getting worse and worse)
- text-kit - flashes all the cards for a short time

# For game
- add a ui-placement system that has coordinates for everything (e.g. limits of board)
