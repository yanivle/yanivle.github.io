        <p>I am a Distinguished Engineer at Google where I lead an
          AI-research lab. I am lucky to work on some of the most interesting problems in AI with some of my best
          friends.
          I am spending a lot of time trying to rethink AI from first principles. For example, we are working on new
          model
          architectures and training schemes for LLMs and image and video generation models.
          We recently made most of Google's important LLMs substantially faster and
          cheaper.</p>

        <p>I have been doing AI research for a long while.
          In 1998, as a high school student, I joined a startup building video
          understanding software where I programmed some neural networks
          (in plain C &#x1f62e;). Previously at Google, I developed and led a team that built an AI system that reads
          and understands the open web.
          Thanks to this system, Google Search shows answers, cards, and lists on a large
          fraction of user queries, like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=homer+simpson">[homer simpson]</a>,
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=world+war+2">[world war 2]</a>, and
          <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=nba+teams">[nba teams]</a>. I also founded and led <a
            href="https://blog.research.google/2018/05/duplex-ai-system-for-natural-conversation.html">Google
            Duplex</a>,
          an AI system that can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM">speak naturally over the
            phone</a>.
          Today, Duplex is a major contributor to Google’s updated business
          data, like opening hours, and data from Duplex’s phone calls was shown to users
          over 1 trillion times.

        <p>A couple of decades ago I've also spent several intensive years working on cryptography and cybersecurity.
          I've met some of the smartest people that I know back then, many of whom are still amongst my best friends.
        I've also spent a few years working on computer graphics, which remains one of my favorite fields to this day.</p>
