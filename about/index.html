        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my personal blog, where you will find my collection of math and hacking coolness,
          including puzzles and write-ups about some of my favorite weekend projects.
          Quality is my top priority, so I am stringent about what I share.
          For example, I only post the very best puzzles that I know, and that I have solved myself.
          I'm really excited to share this collection with you and hope you'll find it as enjoyable to explore as it was
          for me to create.
        </p>

        <h3>Some History</h3>
        <p>
          This is the third iteration of my site, which I first started in 2007 at yaniv.leviathanonline.com. Here’s the
          about page from that first iteration:
        </p>

        <blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">
          <p>
            I started this site as I believe it can be a lot of fun (and I also hope to learn some cool stuff along the
            way). In this site (which has a blog-like structure for now, but I might change that if it proves
            inadequate) I will try to describe some of the most interesting things I know. Some of these are taken
            directly from courses I took at the university, others are the fruits of conversations with friends and
            others yet are some of my own ideas.
            The main topics will probably be Mathematics and Hacking, but I will try to include many other interesting
            things I know of even if they do not fall under these categories.
            An important motto for this site is – “Quality over Quantity”. I really take this seriously and I rather
            delay posting (or cancel them altogether) if I believe they are merely interesting and not really great.
            That said, I will definitely try to post a new topic at least once a week.
            Enjoy!
            Yaniv
            P.S. This is what I look like:
          <div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading"
            style="background-image: url(/assets/images/me_2007.jpg);"></div>
          </p>
          <br>- Me (2007)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          At some point around 2012, I got too busy and stopped maintaining the site and after a few years actually lost
          access to the content.
        </p>

        <div class="img img--fullContainer img--18xLeading"
          style="background-image: url(/assets/images/wayback_machine_yanivleviathanonline_2015snapshot.png); border: 1px solid #ddd;">
        </div>
        <span style="font-size: 0.5em; text-align: center; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">Snapshot by the <a
            style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> of
          yaniv.leviathanonline.com from
          2015.</span>

        <p>
          While the original site was lost, in 2016, using the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a>, I
          managed to restore some of the content,
          and relaunched the site as <a href="https://yanivle.wordpress.com/">Yaniv's Gems</a> on WordPress. It is still
          live today, mostly as a link to this site and for historical purposes:
        </p>
        <div class="img img--fullContainer img--18xLeading"
          style="background-image: url(/assets/images/yanivs_gems.png); border: 1px solid #ddd;"></div>
        <span style="font-size: 0.5em; text-align: center; width: 100%; display: inline-block; margin-top: 0.5em;">The second iteration of
          my site, <a style="text-decoration: underline;" href="https://yanivle.wordpress.com/">Yaniv's Gems</a> still
          lives on
          WordPress for historical purposes only.</span>

        <p>
          In 2020, I finally moved to this present version of the site, <a href="http://yanivle.github.io">yanivle.github.io</a>, with <a
            href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.
          Hopefully, having everything on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> would mean, at the very least, that
          my
          content won't be lost again.
          Note that unlike in previous versions of this site, in this latest iteration I decided to add solutions to the puzzles. I'm adding
          them gradually, so watch out for spoilers!
        </p>

        <p>BTW, I currently work at Google, where I lead the Google Duplex project. And this is what I look like now:
        </p>
        <div class="img img--fullContainer img--18xLeading" style="background-image: url(/assets/images/me.jpg);">
        </div>
