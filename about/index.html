          <h4>This Site</h4>
        <p>
          This is the third iteration of this site.
          I wrote the first version in 2007, during my Maths studies.
          I did a decent job of maintaining the site for a couple of years, but then got too busy and let the site die.
          Unfortunately, most of the content was lost.
          In 2016, I had a new set of math puzzles, and decided it was time to re-launch the site.
          Using the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> I tried to save as much as content as possible from the original site, but many of the graphics and other assets were lost.
          I tried to make up for it by adding a bit of new content, but I didn't like <a href="https://yanivle.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> and being super busy, I just dropped it, again.
          I recently discovered <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and decided it was time to relaunch the site yet again!
          Having everything on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and in the much more robust Markdown format, would mean, at the very least, that my content won't be lost again!
          I looked around for themes, and once I found the beautiful <a href="https://github.com/vincentchan/mickey">Mickey theme</a> by <a href="https://github.com/vincentchan">Vincent Chan</a> all stars aligned and I decided my site is coming back to life!
        </p>
        <h4>Spoiler Alert</h4>
        <p>In this iteration of the site, I decided to <strong>include the solutions to all puzzles</strong> in the posts. I'll be adding them gradually, so beware of spoilers!</p>
        <h4>The About Me Page from 2017</h4>
        This is what I had to say in 2007 when I started the site:
        <blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">
            <p>
                I started this site as I believe it can be a lot of fun (and I also hope to learn some cool stuff along the way). In this site (which has a blog-like structure for now, but I might change that if it proves inadequate) I will try to describe some of the most interesting things I know. Some of these are taken directly from courses I took at the university, others are the fruits of conversations with friends and others yet are some of my own ideas.
                The main topics will probably be Mathematics and Hacking, but I will try to include many other interesting things I know of even if they do not fall under these categories.
                An important motto for this site is – “Quality over Quantity”. I really take this seriously and I rather delay posting (or cancel them altogether) if I believe they are merely interesting and not really great. That said, I will definitely try to post a new topic at least once a week.
                Enjoy!            
                Yaniv
                P.S. This is what I look like:
                <div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url(/assets/images/posts/me.jpg);"></div>
              </p>    
          <br>- Me (2007)
