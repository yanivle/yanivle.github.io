        <h4>This Site</h4>
        <p>
          This is the third iteration of my site.
          I wrote the first version in 2007, during my Maths studies.
          I after maintaining the site for a couple of years, I got too busy, and in 2009 I let the site die.
          Unfortunately, most of the content was lost.
          In 2016, I had a new set of math puzzles, and decided it was time to re-launch the site.
          Using the <a href="https://archive.org/web/">Wayback Machine</a> I tried to rescue as much as content as
          possible from the original site, but many of the graphics and other assets were lost.
          I tried to make up for it by adding a bit of new content, but I didn't like <a
            href="https://yanivle.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a> and being super busy, I just dropped it, again.
          I recently discovered <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> and decided it was time to relaunch
          the site yet again!
          Having everything on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> and in Markdown format,
          would mean, at the very least, that my content won't be lost again!
          I looked around for themes, and once I found the beautiful <a
            href="https://github.com/vincentchan/mickey">Mickey theme</a> by <a
            href="https://github.com/vincentchan">Vincent Chan</a> all stars aligned and I decided my site is coming
          back to life!
          Armed with a lot of ideas for new content - here I go again!
        </p>
        <h4>Spoiler Alert</h4>
        <p>In this iteration of the site, I decided to <strong>include the solutions to the puzzles</strong> in the
          posts. I'll be adding them gradually, so beware of spoilers!</p>
        <h4>Thanks</h4>
        <p>I used a lot of images from the awesome royalty-free images sites <a href="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels</a>
          and
          <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>, and I used the amazing <a
            href="https://github.com/vincentchan/mickey">Mickey theme</a> by <a
            href="https://github.com/vincentchan">Vincent Chan</a>.
          <br />
          Thank you!
        </p>
        <h4>The About Me Page from 2007</h4>
        This is what I had to say in 2007 when I started the site:
        <blockquote class="u--startsWithDoubleQuote">
          <p>
            I started this site as I believe it can be a lot of fun (and I also hope to learn some cool stuff along the
            way). In this site (which has a blog-like structure for now, but I might change that if it proves
            inadequate) I will try to describe some of the most interesting things I know. Some of these are taken
            directly from courses I took at the university, others are the fruits of conversations with friends and
            others yet are some of my own ideas.
            The main topics will probably be Mathematics and Hacking, but I will try to include many other interesting
            things I know of even if they do not fall under these categories.
            An important motto for this site is – “Quality over Quantity”. I really take this seriously and I rather
            delay posting (or cancel them altogether) if I believe they are merely interesting and not really great.
            That said, I will definitely try to post a new topic at least once a week.
            Enjoy!
            Yaniv
            P.S. This is what I look like:

              style="background-image: url(/assets/images/posts/me.jpg);"></div>
