You write down 2 numbers on 2 pieces of paper (one number on each piece). You put each piece of paper in a sealed envelope. I choose one of the envelopes randomly and open it. I then carry out a certain procedure at the end of which I know with a probability greater than $$\frac{1}{2}$$ whether I received the larger or the smaller of the numbers. I can do this even if when you initially wrote down the numbers, you knew my decision procedure!

***How can I do that? What is my trick?***
