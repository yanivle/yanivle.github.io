During a long transatlantic flight, I wrote this simple graphics simulation for my wife. The attraction between these particles symbolizes the immense attraction between me and wife.

<canvas width="800" height="600" id="zlata"></canvas>
<script src="/assets/javascripts/attraction.js"></script>

#### Interaction
**Space** - Set attractors.

**Enter** - Reset attractors.

**Mouse Click** or **Mouse Drag** - Set attractors to mouse.

Enjoy!
