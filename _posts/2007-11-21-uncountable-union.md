A very interesting riddle for those of you with some basic background in Set Theory.

##### Prove or Disprove the Following Claim:

$$\exists B \subset \wp(\mathbb{N}) \text{ s.t. } |B| = \aleph, \text{ and } B \text{ is completely ordered by the subset relation}.$$

##### Notes:
$$\mathbb{N}$$ denotes the set of natural numbers.

$$\aleph$$ denotes the cardinality of the continuum (i.e. $$\aleph = 2^{\aleph_0}$$).

“B is completely ordered by the subset relation” means that for every two elements a, b of B, either a is a subset of b or b is a subset of a.
