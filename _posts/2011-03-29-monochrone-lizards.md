There are 3 types of lizards: yellow, green and blue.

If you rub 2 lizards from different colors, they both change color to the third color. So, for example, if you rub a yellow lizard and a blue lizard, you get 2 green lizards.

**Say that you have X yellow lizards, Y green lizards and Z blue lizards. For what values of X, Y and Z can you transform all the lizards to the same color?**

E.g. for X=3, Y=3 and Z=1 it is possible (rub the 3 yellow ones with the 3 green ones and get a total of 7 blue ones).
