#### Algorithm A

Given an array of N integers, sort the array, and find the 2 consecutive numbers in the sorted array with the maximum difference.
Example - on input [1,7,3,2] output 4 (the sorted array is [1,2,3,7], and the maximum difference is 7-3=4).

Algorithm A runs in O(NlogN) time.

Implement an algorithm identical in function to algorithm A, that runs in O(N) time.

Thanks to Yossi Richter for this riddle!
