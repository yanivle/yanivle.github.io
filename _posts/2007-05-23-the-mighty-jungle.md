I visited my parents yesterday, for the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. I found there a picture of myself and some friends from the time we sailed on the [Tuichi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuichi_River) in Bolivia on a raft we built ourselves with machetes. Here is the picture and a legend:

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/prison.jpg" %}

Note that the picture is very dark, as it was taken in the night time.

I have to admit that looking at the picture, it seems that we are escaping from a prison. To make this post more in the spirit of my site I could have added one of the many prison riddles here, but I must say I am happy with this post just the way it is (maybe I will update it with a prison-riddle in the future).

This other cool picture I stumbled upon in my parents house, I call “What’s for Dinner?”:

I took it in the market of the city of [Cusco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusco), Peru.

Happy holidays!
