We need to build a data structure that simulates a ball pit. It needs to support 3 operations:

`void Insert(int color)` - Add a ball of color $$color$$ to the pit.

`void Remove(int color)` - Remove a ball of color $$color$$ from the pit. If the pit doesn't contain a ball of the color $$color$$, the behavior is undefined.

`bool Unique()` - Returns true i.f.f. all the balls in the pit are of the same color.

***Can you implement this data structure with less than O(n) memory? (where n is the number of colors)?***

## Spoiler Alert - Solution Ahead!

We can implement this data structure with just 3 counters: $$n$$, $$\sum{x_i}$$, $$\sum{x_{i}^{2}}$$.

Implement the operations as follows:

```c++
void Insert(int color) {
  n++;
  sigma_xi += color;
  sigma_xi2 += color * color;
}

void Remove(int color) {
  n--;
  sigma_xi -= color;
  sigma_xi2 -= color * color;
}

bool Unique() {
  if (sigma_xi % n != 0) return false;
  int x = sigma_xi / n;
  return sigma_xi2 == x * x * n;
}
```

Obviously if all the balls in the pit are the same color, `Unique` will return true. To show that `Unique` cannot return true otherwise, note that the function $$\sum{x_{i}^2}$$ strictly gets its minimum (subject to a fixed sum of the $$x_i$$s) when all the $$x_i$$ are equal. $$\blacksquare$$
