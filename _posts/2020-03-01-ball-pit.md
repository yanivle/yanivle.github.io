We need to build a data structure that simulates a ball pit. It needs to support 3 operations:

`void Insert(int color)` - Add a ball of color $$color$$ to the pit.

`void Remove(int color)` - Remove a ball of color $$color$$ from the pit. If the pit doesn't contain a ball of the color $$color$$, the behavior is undefined.

`bool Unique()` - Returns true i.f.f. all the balls in the pit are of the same color.

***Can you implement this data structure with less than O(n) memory? (where n is the number of colors)?***
