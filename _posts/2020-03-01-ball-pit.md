We need to build a data structure that simulates a ball pit. It needs to support 3 operations:
* $$void Insert(color)$$ - add a ball of color $$color$$ to the pit.
* $$void Remove(color)$$ - remove a ball of color $$color$$ from the pit. If the pit doesn't contain a ball of the color $$color$$, the behavior is undefined.
* $$bool Unique()$$ - returns true i.f.f. all the balls in the pit are of the same color.

***Can you implement this data structure with less than O(n) memory? (where n is the number of colors)?***
