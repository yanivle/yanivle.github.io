There are 1000 ants walking on a horizontal stick, 1m long.
Each ant is walking at a constant rate of 1m/hour.
The ants start out in random locations on the stick, some walking to the left and some to the right.
Whenever two ants meet they reverse their direction, as follows:

{% include image.html url="/assets/images/posts/ants_diagram.gif" %}

Whenever an ant reaches one of the ends of the stick, it falls off (eventually all ants will fall).

***What is the longest time it will take the last ant to fall off the stick?***

> The Ants riddle is one of my all time favorites. It requires an imaginative mind, but does not require any knowledge of mathematics.
