There are 100 coins on the table. 90 of the coins have their Heads face up, the other 10 have their Tails face up. Your task is to split the coins into two groups, such that both groups contain the same number of coins with their Heads face up. You are even allowed to flip the coins...

***The catch is that you cannot see the coins - you are blindfolded!***

What is your strategy?
