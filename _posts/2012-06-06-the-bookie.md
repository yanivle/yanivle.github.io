These are two nice and easy gambling related riddles.

### Double or Nothing

FC Barcelona  and Real Madrid C.F. will be playing 7 games against each other this season. I give you \\$1,000 and ask you to double it in case Barça wins overall (i.e. if they win at least 4 of the 7 games). You are allowed to lose all of it otherwise.

You have a honest bookie which gives you 1-1 odds on each game, but he is only willing to take bets on single games, not on the entire season.

***How can you double my money?***

Note that you are not allowed to take loans, so if for example you bet \\$30 on Barça in the first game and they win you have a maximum of \\$1,030 to bet on for the second game, and if they lose, you have a maximum of \\$970 to bet on the second game.

### Beat the Bookie

This second riddle is even easier. There are n horses in a horse race. Your bookie gives you $$X_1, ..., X_n$$ – the odds for each horse.

For example, if $$X_2$$ is 3, for each dollar you place on horse 2 you will get 3 dollars if horse 2 wins.

***Under what condition on the $$X_i$$'s can you guarantee to make money?***
