### Il Buono (nice and easy)

Prove that in a subset of size $$n+1$$ of the set $$\{1, 2, ..., 2n\}$$ there are two numbers such that one divides the other.

### Il Cattivo (beautiful and hard)

Prove that in a sequence of $$r\times s+1$$ distinct numbers, there is either a monotonically increasing sub-sequence of length $$r+1$$ or a monotonically decreasing sub-sequence of length $$s+1$$.

### Il Brutto (just easy)

Prove that in a subset of size n+1 of the set $$\{1, 2, ..., 2n\}$$ there are two relatively prime numbers (i.e. numbers whose gcd is 1).

### Il Non Collegato (another easy one)

Prove that a degree 7 polynomial with integer coefficients, that receives the values +1 or -1 on 7 integer points is irreducible over the integers.
