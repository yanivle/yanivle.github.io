There are 100 red points and 100 blue points on the plane, such that no three points are on the same line.

A ***pairing*** of the points is a one-to-one function that assigns one blue dot to each red dot.

A ***valid planar pairing*** is a pairing such that when paired points are connected with a straight line segment, no line intersections occur.

**Prove that there exists a valid planar pairing.**

Thanks to Nadav Sherman for giving me this one.

### Extra Credit
Is the claim true in the case that the sets of red and blue points are infinite?
