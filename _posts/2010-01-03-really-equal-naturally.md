You have a set of 2N+1 natural numbers, with the following property: if you remove any one element, you can partition the remaining 2N elements into two sets A and B, each of size N, such that the sum of the N numbers in set A equals the sum of the N numbers in set B. Prove that all the numbers in the original set are equal.

Try to solve the riddle in the more general case, where the numbers are not necessarily natural, but arbitrary reals (some knowledge of algebra is helpful here).
