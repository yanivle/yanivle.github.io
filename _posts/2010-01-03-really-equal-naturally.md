You have a set of 2N+1 real numbers, with the following property: if you remove any one element, you can partition the remaining 2N elements into two sets, *A* and *B*, each of size N, such that the sum of the N numbers in set *A* equals the sum of the N numbers in set *B*. Prove that all the numbers in the original set are equal.

### Spoiler Alert - Hint Ahead
Start by trying to solve the riddle for the special case where the set contains only *natural numbers* instead of general reals.
