During a long transatlantic flight, I wrote this simple graphics simulation for my wife Zlata.

<canvas width="800" height="600" id="zlata" style="width:100%;"></canvas>
<script src="/assets/javascripts/attraction.js"></script>

#### Interaction
**Space** - Set attractors (try clicking it repeatedly). On a mobile device you can click on the red semi-circle at the top of the canvas instead.

**Enter** - Reset attractors. On a mobile device just let go.

**Mouse Click** or **Mouse Drag** - Set attractors to mouse. On a mobile device just touch the canvas - try dragging your finger!

Enjoy!
