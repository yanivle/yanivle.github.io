During a transatlantic flight, I wrote this simple particle attraction simulation for my wife Zlata (to symbolize the attraction between us :)).

<p></p>

<canvas width="800" height="600" id="zlata" style="width:100%;"></canvas>
<script src="/assets/javascripts/attraction.js"></script>

#### Interaction
**Space** - Set attractors (try clicking it repeatedly). On a mobile device you can hold the red semi-circle at the top of the canvas.

**Enter** - Reset attractors. On a mobile device just let go.

**Mouse Click** or **Mouse Drag** - Set attractors to mouse. On a mobile device just touch the canvas - try dragging your finger!

It's pretty fun (and dare I say, Zen) to try and create certain shapes. For example, can you create 2 stable distinct concentric circles? How about 3? Can you reverse their order? Can you create a rectangle? How about an X shape?

Enjoy!
